<h1>Definitions</h1>
<h3>meeting (noun)</h3>
<p>A meeting has a collection of 'member/state/notified' triplets.  A meeting has a 'name' and a 'unique ID'. A meeting has a 'state'. 
When all member triplets have a state value of 'ready', the meeting state is also 'ready'.</p>
<h3>member (noun)</h3>
<p>A participant in a transaction.  A member can call verbs on a meeting.</p>
<h3>state (noun)</h3>
<p>A value for the participant's readiness, or the meeting's overall readiness.  Takes the value 'unready' or 'ready'.</p>
<h3>notified (noun)</h3>
<p>A value indicating if the member has been notified that a meeting is ready.</p>
<h3>define (verb)</h3>
<p>A member can define a new meeting.  The member provides the meeting 'name'.  The 'unique ID' for the meeting is
returned to the member that created the meeting.  The member that creates a meeting is added to the list of members in that
meeting.</p>
<h3>modify (verb)</h3>
<p>A member can add or remove 'member/state/notified' triplets from a meeting.  Each triplet is identified by the 'member' value.</p>
<h3>check (verb)</h3>
<p>A member can query for a list of meetings that they are a member of.</p>
<h3>update (verb)</h3>
<p>A member can update their state for a meeting as 'ready' or 'unready'.  This modifies the corresponding entry in the meeting's
'member/state/notified' list.  Once a meeting is in the 'ready' state, a member cannot update their state to 'unready'.</p>
<h3>notify (verb)</h3>
<p>When a meeting has a state of 'ready', all members may be notified that the meeting is ready.  No new 'member/state/notified' 
triplets can be added to the meeting.  Given that communications are state-less, a member has to query when a meeting is ready.
When a member is told that a meeting is ready, their 'member/state/notified' triplet is updated to set the notified value to 'true'.
(Note - consider the situation where a member calls 'modified' on a meeting that is 'ready'.  This implies that a member should be
returned an error that defines the meeting as ready.  Now consider the same situation where the member calls modified and no member 
has been notified yet.  Do we allow the modify action and return the state to unready?  Are we saying that the meeting is only in state 
'ready' once a member has been notified?)</p>
<h3>death (verb)</h3>
<p>This is the end of the meeting object's existence.  When all members have been notified, the meeting is destroyed.  Alternatively,
once an acceptable time has passed since the meeting entered the ready state (that is to say, all members are ready), the meeting is 
destroyed.</p>

<h1>Extras</h1>
<h3>List all meetings</h3>
<p>The server can be queried for all living meetings</p>
<h3>List a meeting</h3>
<p>The 'member/state/notified' list for a meeting can be queried, along with the meeting 'name', 'unique ID' and 'state'.</p>

<h1>Problems</h1>
<p>What about badly behaved members; what about members who never go ready?  Need to draw out state diagram and make sure all 
states have an inherent path to 'finished'.</p>
